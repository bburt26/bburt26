# About me


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to wrangle and tidy data, how to conduct exploratory data analysis, and how to use Git and GitHub.
- 💬 Ask me about my semester abroad in Spain or rock and alternative music.
- ⚡ Fun fact: On a field trip to Washington D.C. in 2015, I met the now King and Queen of England, Charles and Camilla.
- *I have a pug named clyde🐕‍🦺*
